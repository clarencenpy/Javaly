A web-based platform for authoring and automatically grading programming problems written in Java

* Question authoring with support for writing test cases or creating them through the GUI
* Instructors can create groups for their students to join, and push exercises to them
* See an overview of your student's progress as they code in **real time**!
* See overall statistics of their solve timings to identify students who need help
