        <p>Javaly is a teaching tool for programming, with the mission of making interactive coding in class seamless and fun.</p>
        <p>While students solve questions on the webapp, instructors are able to monitor their progress and solve-statistics in real time, helping them to identify areas where students are weaker at. TAs can also benefit from this platform, as they are better able to give feedback to the students with the Shared Codepad.</p>
